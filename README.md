## 🚩 Problem Statement
Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Better water supplies and sanitation, as well as better management of water resources, can contribute greatly to poverty reduction and economic growth.
It is known that contaminated water and inadequate sanitation facilitate the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. Those without access to clean water and sanitation face preventable health risks. 

## 🎯 Objective
To understand what constitutes safe, potable water and distinguish between potable and non-potable water by applying machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability) contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.
- ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).
- Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
- Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
- Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
- Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
- Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
- Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
- Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.
- Turbidity: Measure of light emitting property of water in NTU.
- Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable - 1 and Not potable - 0
